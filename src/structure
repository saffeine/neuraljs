STARTING AGAIN FOR MY OWN FUCKING SANITY.

[innovation]
    - keeps track of all evolution history.
    - provides newly added neurons with a unique id.
    - provides newly added synapses with a unique id.

[genome]
    - based on an innovation's history, creates a network of neurons and synapses.
    - can be mutated, adds new mutated features to the innovation history if they do not already exist.
    - can be bred with another genome to produce a potentially fitter result.
    - this is the 'raw' data to be processed by the brain in a more defined way.

[neuron]
    - serves as a node inside a genome, holds a value in the processing step.
    - contains an x and y value for more precise manipulation later.

[synapse]
    - serves as a connection inside a genome, potentially holds a value for weight if averaging doesn't work.
    - contains a 'from' and 'to' value to link two neurons together.

[network]
    - utilised only by the brain to be able to process data.
    - takes in data from a genome, hard-bakes it into a set of neurons and synapses with values.

[brain]
    - handles all of the actual processing, everything else is just data.
